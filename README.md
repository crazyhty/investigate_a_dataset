# Project Overview
This is the 2nd project of Udacity Data And Analytic NANODEGREE Program. 
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. 
I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

Introduction
I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. 
I should start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. 
Then I should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I'm most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
This project is open-ended rather than looking for one right answer.

# Data Set
The data comes from the FBI's
National Instant Criminal Background
Check System. The NICS is used by to
determine whether a prospective
buyer is eligible to buy firearms or
explosives. Gun shops call into this
system to ensure that each customer
does not have a criminal record or
isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a
purchase. The data has been
supplemented with state level data
from census.gov.
● The NICS data is found in one
sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains
the number of firearm checks by
month, state, and type.
● The U.S. census data is found
in a .csv file. It contains several
variables at the state level. Most
variables just have one data
point per state (2016), but a few
have data for more than one
year.

# What will I learn?
Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
